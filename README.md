# stc-kliwongan-2022
Shopify Technical Challenge Submission for the Backend Developer Intern position

## Tech stack:
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy
- React JS + Bootstrap
- Heroku (backend)
- CORS proxy server (to allow Replit to query the API since Heroku's CORS config is complicated)

## Instructions

The app itself is mostly self explanatory. The navigation bar and the buttons/links on each item explain their purposes too.
I will only explain very specific details.

### Creating items

Since I am not running form validation, even if you do submit empty fields, an item will be created regardless.

### Updating items

Since the values have placeholders, you only have to fill in the inputs that you want to change.
If you leave the rest blank, the values will stay the same.

## Additional notes

NOTE: If the navbar does not toggle, please expand your screen size so you can access the navbar items.

NOTE: If you're curious, we have a Swagger UI running on
https://stc-kliwn-backend.herokuapp.com/docs where you can play around with the web requests yourselves!
