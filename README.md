# stc-kliwongan-2022
Shopify Technical Challenge Submission for the Backend Developer Intern position

## Tech stack:
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy
- React JS + Bootstrap
- CORS proxy server (to allow Replit to query the API)

## Instructions

The app itself is self explanatory. The navigation bar and the buttons on each item explain their purposes too.
NOTE: If the navbar does not toggle, please expand your screen size so you can access the navbar items.

NOTE: In case the frontend on Replit does not work, we have a backend running on
https://stc-kliwn-backend.herokuapp.com/docs where you can play around with the web requests yourselves!
