# stc-kliwongan-2022
Shopify Technical Challenge Submission for the Backend Developer Intern position

## Tech stack:
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy
- React JS + Bootstrap
- Heroku (backend)
- CORS proxy server (to allow Replit to query the API since Heroku's CORS config is complicated)

## Instructions

The app itself is self explanatory. The navigation bar and the buttons on each item explain their purposes too.

NOTE: If the navbar does not toggle, please expand your screen size so you can access the navbar items.

NOTE: If you're curious, we have a Swagger UI running on
https://stc-kliwn-backend.herokuapp.com/docs where you can play around with the web requests yourselves!
